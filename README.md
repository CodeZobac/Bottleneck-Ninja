## Overview

Bottleneck Ninja is a powerful web application designed to identify and solve hardware bottlenecks in PC systems with AI. The tool helps users optimize their computer builds by analyzing the compatibility and performance balance between CPU, GPU, and RAM

## Key Features

- **Hardware Bottleneck Analysis**: Identify performance limitations in your PC build
- **Build Comparison**: Compare different hardware configurations side by side
- **Component Recommendations**: Get smart suggestions to improve your system's performance
- **User Profiles**: Save your builds and track performance improvements over time
- **Interactive Charts**: Visualize bottlenecks and performance metrics
- **Build Sharing**: Share your configurations with the community

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React 19, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **Database**: Supabase
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts
- **UI Components**: Radix UI, React Aria Components

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Bottleneck-Ninja.git
cd Bottleneck-Ninja/bottleneckCalculator
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
